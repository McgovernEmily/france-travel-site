# france-travel-site

Have you ever wanted to travel to a beautiful country full of wonder and culture, but need help knowing
where to book everything or where to start? This beautiful French traveling website will display cozy
hotels, delicious restaurants, and fun-filled activities. It will be an easy way for travelers to get
ideas of what to do while they travel around France.

This was a personal project for creating a travel website. Continued to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Gave me skills in knowing how to combine the 3 languages to make a beautiful website.
